# Markov Kaleidoscope
## Description
This code creates Kaleidoscope art using pre-defined Markov Chains to determine visual elements such as shape, color, and pattern transitions. For shapes, the program at any state can either draw an arc or an ellipse. There are many colors that the Kaleidoscope can pick from, ranging from Violet to Pink! For patterns, the number of sides ranges from 5 - 30. 
## How to Set Up and Run the Code:
1. Open the terminal
2. Install the Python PIL library
```
$ pip install Pillow
```
3. Download this project from Github
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YiYang02/A-Markov-Distinction.git
```
4. Change your directory to this project
5. Run the program!
```
$ python3 markov_code.py
```
## Reflection:
**Describe how the system is personally meaningful to you**
This system is personally meaningful to me because I've always wanted to create a computational art system without heavily leaning on the use of AI. In recent months, I've been fascinated by the leaps in advances within Generative AI Art and have been playing around with several AI image generation models such as Dall-E Mini, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Moreover, when it came time for me to try and create my own AI image generation model, I felt very intimidated by all the machine learning techniques and jargon I had to learn. Given that Markov Chains is a  fairly simple probabilistic model that I've learned in AI previously, I'm really happy with my program! 

Besides my system being intellectually meaningful to me, my system also showcases my "creative" aspect in a new way. Traditional forms of creativity has always been in the form of art, something that I'm not particularly good at (I can only draw stick figures). However, I am good at coding! Through code, I've learned to be able to express my own take on Kaleidoscopes without having to pick up a color pencil!
